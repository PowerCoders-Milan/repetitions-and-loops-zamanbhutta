## Arrays

Let's work with the arrays, perform all these tasks on the array.

```javascript
// you're gonna use this array
var array = ["Banana", "Apples", "Oranges", "Blueberries"];
```
1. `Access` and `output` *Oranges*
2. `Remove` *Banana* from the `array`
3. `Sort` the array in **alphabetical** order
4. `Put` *Kiwi* at the end of the array
5. `Remove` *Apples* from the array
6. `Sort` the array in **reverse** order, i.e. ['a', 'b', 'b'] becomes ['c', 'b', 'a']

At the end you should have
```javascript
["Kiwi", "Oranges", "Blueberries"]
```
