## Multiplication Tables

In this exercise we will review a simple math concept, table of 9.

#### instructions
1. Write a `for loop` that will iterate from 0 to 10.
2. `For each` iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9.
3. `Log` the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").

## Optional: Table of all numbers from 1 to 9
Write a function that gives the table of any number that you pass to it.

Have a good time, and don't get crazy with math.
