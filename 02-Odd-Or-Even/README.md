## ODD or EVEN reporter

This excercise is about loops and conditions.

For the looping part, try 3 different types of loop!

instructions:
1. Write a for `loop` that will iterate from 0 to 20.
2. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd.
3. Report the result to the screen (e.g. "2 is even").

Repeat the exercise with `while` and `do while` 

Have a great looping ðŸ’ª
